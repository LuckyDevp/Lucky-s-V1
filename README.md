# Lucky's V1

Lucky's is an external executor for Roblox that allows you to run Lua scripts without any issues. I hope you enjoy this project I made. Updates might take a while since this project is developed by a single developer.

## Installation

First, you need to install the installer by clicking [here](https://lucky.net). Once installed, accept all the prompts, and once completed, you'll need to follow us on my social media. After that, just join a Roblox game and wait for a notification. Once received, you'll be able to execute and use scripts.

## About Me

I am **Lucky's Developer**, the main and only developer of this project. Currently, I have knowledge of C++, Java, JavaScript, and others. I was inspired to create this project because there aren't many executors for PC (or at least that's what I think). I hope to release updates more frequently for better comfort and security.

## Terms and Conditions

By installing this program, you agree to my terms and conditions of use, which are... none. D:

## Support and Contact

You can contact me via the email on my profile or at [sourcdevs@outlook.com](mailto:sourcdevs@outlook.com). If you have any suggestions, bugs, or complaints, don't hesitate to reach out—it helps me improve.

## Upcoming Goals for Version V2

My goal is to enhance the anti-ban security for Roblox, as there have been many bans lately. Additionally, I want to implement a feature that automatically closes the Roblox app if a potential ban is detected, and you'll receive a notification. I also plan to add a script search function so you can easily find scripts. Another idea is to create a website where you can upload scripts for the community—**for educational purposes only**.

Thank you so much for your support! <3
